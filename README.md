  -  Encapsulated app components using Object Oriented Programming principles and enabled users to select additional functionalities from the settings menu
  
  #### [:computer:CaptionConcierge WebApp](https://github.com/afahimi/CaptionConcierge-NWHacks2023) - Hackathon(NWhacks)
  - Cooperated in a team of four to build a full-stack React web application that leveraged AI to summarize YouTube videos
  - Utilized Python and Flask to build a back-end server that parsed and transmitted YouTube captions to front-end application via HTTP requests
  -  Incorported the OpenAI model GTP-3 API to enhance summarization process without altering the original concepts
  
  ### :school: UBC Course Projects
  <strong>*Code access is available upon request for all projects*</strong>
  
  #### [Dancing Robot](https://github.com/CPEN-291/P1_L2A_G21) - CPEN 291
  - Built and programmed a dancing robot with wireless capabilities, LED display, sonar sensor, and piezo buzzer
  -  Deployed backend flask python server that sent dance instructions and sequences via HTTP requests
  - Synchronized LED display with dance movements to create pleasant viewer experience
  
  #### [Image Unscrambler](https://github.com/divy-07/CPSC221-PA1) - CPSC 221
  - Applied Object Oriented Programming in C++ to unscramble chopped-up images by analysing pixel data
  - Debugged program functionality using GDB ensuring proper pointer manipulation and memory management
  - Incorporated double linked lists to represent the order of image snippets when unscrambling
  
  #### [Publish/Subscribe Server](https://cpen221-ubc.notion.site/Message-Queues-Pub-Sub-with-Twitter-c5965b28ed01482aad44dbaadac19b77) - CPEN 221
