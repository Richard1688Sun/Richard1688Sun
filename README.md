<!----- About Me ----->

<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>

I am a driven UBC Engineering student interested in computers and software. In my free time, I enjoy pursuing personal programming projects, cycling, playing soccer, learning about new technologies and [taking landscape photos](https://photography.eliodinino.com).

  One of my values is to always continue learning. To uphold this, I pursue projects that require me to learn new skills and I seek new experiences, often outside of my comfort zone. I also look to meet new people and challenge myself whenever I can. I believe that this continuous learning and seeking of challenges is important to my growth and adaptability.
  
  My hard-working nature and natural leadership skills make me a valuable team member who can both listen and lead if needed. Furthermore, my attention to detail and organizational skills contribute to the timely completion of high-quality deliverables. As a result of these core attributes, along with my past experiences and promising future, I was awarded full-ride scholarships to both UBC and McMaster University.

  
  ## :dart: Professional Goal
  I hope to use my current and future skills to pursue a career in the Computer Engineering field. To get there I am looking to try many different roles through co-ops and volunteering opportunities at UBC. Following this, I will seek a career that I am passionate about and one that makes a positive impact on the world.
