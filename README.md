    <p>In our dancing robot team project, we brought to life a captivating dancing robot equipped with wireless capabilities, an LED display, a sonar sensor, and a piezo buzzer. Serving as the lead developer, I spearheaded the construction and programming of the robot, orchestrating the movements of four servo motors acting as joints through the Pico Microcontroller. The firmware code, written in Python scripting and utilizing the CircuitPython library, governed the robot's choreography. As part of my role, I deployed a backend flask Python server responsible for sending dance instructions and sequences via HTTP requests, ensuring seamless coordination. A notable aspect of the project was the synchronization of the LED display with dance movements, creating a delightful viewer experience. This endeavor not only showcased my technical expertise in hardware and software integration but also underscored my collaborative and planning skills, contributing to the successful realization of a fully functional and engaging dancing robot.</p>
